## 🎨 Design Notes

The design follows a dark-themed gradient background with coral-colored highlights to draw user attention to CTAs and icons. Typography is clean and readable, with central alignment for major text blocks to maintain visual harmony.

The original design reference was created by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer and later implemented using HTML and CSS for practice.

---

## 📱 Responsiveness

The site uses relative units and Flexbox to adapt layouts for multiple screen sizes:
- **Desktop:** Full-width hero image with centered CTA.
- **Tablet:** Adjusted spacing and stacked icon sections.
- **Mobile:** Vertical flow with smaller text and buttons for easy touch navigation.

---

## 📬 Contact Section

The form includes three fields:
- Name  
- Email  
- Message  

It’s currently static but can be integrated with a backend (e.g. PHP, Node.js, or Formspree) for functionality.
